# Isa100days

I have played with Isabelle before, but not intensely.
I'm now writing one proof every day for 100 days to get a firmer grip.
The first ones will be based on [exercises](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/exercises/) and later ones will be more serious.

P1: simple stuff

P2-8: 1.1-1.6, 1.8

P9-10: 3.1-2

P11-2: 4.1-2

P13: 1.7

P14: 1.9
